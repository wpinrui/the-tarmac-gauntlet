# Unity project

Unity 6000.6.7f1. Open this `unity/` folder in the Unity Hub.

`Assets/Simulation/` is the headless C# port of the TypeScript simulation. It has its own
assembly (`TarmacGauntlet.Simulation.asmdef`) with no UnityEngine references.

## Running the simulation tests

The same `.cs` files also build as a plain .NET library, so the tests run without Unity.
Needs the .NET 8 SDK.

```
dotnet test unity/dotnet/TarmacGauntlet.Simulation.Tests
```

`dotnet/TarmacGauntlet.Simulation` builds the sources against netstandard2.1 and C# 9,
the same API level and language version Unity uses, so anything that passes here also
compiles in Unity.
